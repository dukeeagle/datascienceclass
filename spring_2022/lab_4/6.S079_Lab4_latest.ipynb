    "**Question (10 pts)**: Contrast the two similarity matrices above, explaining the technical source of the discrepancies. You don't need to explain every pair of sentences for which they differ; provide examples and the general principle. What types of input would each similarity metric be best suited for?\n",

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "With \"Tim absolutely loves Korn\" versus \"Tim loves the band Korn\", the San Francisco similarity matrix correctly determines that the two phrases are highly similar. However, Jaccard matrix only determines moderate similarity. The cosine similarity method performs better because its training corpus reveals that \"absolutely adores\" and \"adores\" mean the same thing. The Jaccard metric simply regards these phrases as dissimilar.\n",
